# Personal Debian 12 Server Environment

This repository contains the automation scripts and configuration details for my self-hosted, headless Debian 12 server. This environment is used for personal software testing, development sandboxing, and hosting game servers (e.g., Minecraft).

This project demonstrates hands-on experience in:
* Linux System Administration (Debian 12)
* Server Security & Hardening (Fail2ban, SSH Configuration)
* Network Configuration (Dynamic DNS)
* Bash Scripting & Automation
* Process Management with `tmux`

## 📸 System Overview

### System Details (Neofetch)
A quick look at the server's specifications via `neofetch`.

### Tmux Session Dashboard
This is the environment created by the `serverdb.sh` script. It shows `btop` monitoring system resources in the top pane for system monitoring, and the Minecraft server console running in the bottom pane.

## 🔒 Security & Network Configuration

A key part of this project was making the server securely accessible from the internet.

* **Remote Access:** Configured the **SSH daemon** (sshd_config) for secure remote access, disabling root login and securing from online attacks.
* **Intrusion Prevention:** Deployed **Fail2ban** to automatically monitor SSH logs and ban IP addresses that exhibit brute-force attack patterns.
* **Dynamic DNS (DDNS):** Set up a DDNS client on the server to automatically update the A record for a **personal domain name**. This allows for a consistent, easy-to-remember address (`server.domainName.com`) to connect to the server, even with a dynamic home IP address.

## 🤖 Automation Scripts

This repository includes two key Bash scripts used to manage and monitor the server.

### 1. `serverdb.sh` (Server Dashboard)

This script bootstraps the main server environment in a `tmux` session. It's designed to start the Minecraft server and a system monitor simultaneously for a complete dashboard.

**What it does:**
1.  **Checks for Session:** Checks if a `tmux` session named `minecraft` already exists.
2.  **Attaches (if exists):** If the session is already running, it simply attaches you to it.
3.  **Creates & Splits (if new):** If the session doesn't exist, it:
    * Creates a new detached session named `minecraft`.
    * Splits the window vertically (top pane for monitoring, bottom for the server).
    * Runs `btop` (a system resource monitor) in the top pane.
    * Changes to the `BMC3_Server_Pack_v22` directory and executes the `./start.sh` script in the bottom pane to launch the server.
4.  **Attaches:** Finally, it attaches the user to the newly created session.

### 2. `logsum.sh` (Log Summary)

This script is a data-processing utility for the Minecraft server. It parses all log files (both the current `latest.log` and older, gzipped archives) to extract all player join/leave events. It then compiles them into a single, clean summary file.

**What it does:**
1.  **Initializes:** Creates a `~/logs` directory if one doesn't exist.
2.  **Creates Summary File:** Wipes and creates a new `player_activity_summary.txt` with a timestamp.
3.  **Processes `latest.log`:** Copies and `grep` the current, unzipped log for join/leave events.
4.  **Processes Archives:** Loops through all `*.log.gz` files, copies them, unzips the copies, and `grep` them for join/leave events.
5.  **Aggregates:** Appends all findings, organized by log file, into the summary file.

#### Example Output (`player_activity_summary.txt`)

Here is a sample of the output file generated by the script:

  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
